    "\n",
    "Gas is driven in and out of tissue by the difference in pressure: \"outside\" aka ambient $ P_{amb} $ &nbsp; and \"inside\" aka dissolved gas pressure, $ P_{t} $. The rate is assumed to be $ ln(2) $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partial pressure** refers to pressures of individual gases in the breathing mix: oxygen, nitrogen, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tissue compartments\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate real tissue the model uses hypothetical \"compartments\". They are defined by the time $ T_{ h } $ it takes for the pressure difference (above) to get to -- since we're using log 2 -- half (or double, depending on whether the tissues in on- or off-gassing) its intial value. That time is callled ``half time``. It is usually given in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body is modelled as a set of \"tissue compartments\" with different half-times. They have nothing to do with real tissues, but to illustrate the concept it is usually said that blood is \"fast\": gas gets in and out very quickly, whereas bone is very \"slow\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### M-values\n",
    "\n",
    "The greater the difference between $ P_{amb} $ &nbsp; and $ P_t $, the faster the gas flows. There is, however, such thing as too fast. To recreational divers \"too fast\" is only relevant on the way up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model defines \"maximum allowed pressure difference\" value, ``M-value`` for short. The model does not attempt to quantify the risk, it only works in binary \"above the M-value\" (bad) or \"below the M-value\" (OK) terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haldane originally set his M-value as a fixed ratio (2:1). Workman replaced it with a function: a straight line $ M = \\Delta M + M_0 $ with greater overpressure tolerated at greater depths."
